# 1. Switches, Logic Gates, Combinational Circuits

The goal of this workshop is to build a retro computer (roughly equivalent to what
people would have bought in the early 1990s for their home) called Pegasus 42 and
use it to program simple games. The idea is that the project can be completely
understood from the lowest level to the overall system.

For this we will initially use a simulator, and then move on to a FPGA (Field
Programmable Gate Array - a chip which can be reconfigured to implement any
digital circuit). For each level of abstraction there are several different
simulators we can use. From a high to low level we have:

| Level | Example Simulators |
|-------|--------------------|
| Architecture | QEMU, MAME |
| Micro-architecture | SPIM, SimpleScalar |
| Register Transfer | Verilator, ModelSim |
| Logic Gate | Digital, TkGate |
| Switches | IRSIM, MOSSIM |
| Analog Circuits | Spice, Xyce |
| Components | TCAD, DEVSIM |
| Physics | Elmer, Matlab |

The advantage of using a simulator instead of the real thing is being able to
see details that would be very hard, if not impossible, to measure in the
actual circuit. The low level simulators show far more details than the high
level ones, but are propotionally slower when running on the same computer.
So while it would be possible to simulate a whole computer using Spice, it might
take minutes for the simulated circuit to execute a single instruction. We
might have to wait for weeks to see if it correctly boots or not. Normally we
use the low level simulators for small subcircuits and then higher level
simuladors for the whole system.

When we said that the goal was to understand Pegasus 42 at the lowest level
we exagerated a bit. We will consider the switch level as being the lowest
one in this workshop. Even though Digital is not optimized for this level,
it is sufficient to illustrate the ideas that will be presented. It is also
not optimized for the higher levels, mas for the reduced projects that will
be studied it is sufficient (though too slow to show the operation of
circuits that output video in a usable manner).

An abstract representation of a system is a box with a number of inputs and
some outputs. Normally we will show the inputs coming from the left and the
outputs going right, but we can ignore this rule if it makes the drawing
more confusing.
