# Pegasus 42 Project

The goal for this Gambiconf 2025 workshop is to show how the most basic elements of
digital computers and videogame work and how they can be combined to create more
complex blocks up to a whole computer.

A simulator (called [Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital)) will be used to allow
the workshop participants to experiment for themselves with all the presented circuits.

## 1. Switches, Logic Gates, Combinational Circuits
## 2. Sequential Circtuis
## 3. Processors
## 4. FPGAs and Shin JAMMA
## 5. Video
## 6. RISC-V

In addition to the material presented in the workshop, the following appendices show
more advanced projects that extend the same concepts in three different directions.
A history of the Pegasus project is also included.

## A. PPU
## B. Caches and SDRAM
## C. Microelectronics
## D. History
