# Pegasus 42 Project

The goal for this Gambiconf 2025 workshop is to show how the most basic elements of
digital computers and videogame work and how they can be combined to create more
complex blocks up to a whole computer.

A simulator (called [Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital)) will be used to allow
the workshop participants to experiment for themselves with all the presented circuits.

## [1. Switches, Logic Gates, Combinational Circuits](1.comb.md)

These are the basic blocks of digital circuits.

## [2. Sequential Circuits](2.seq.md)

More complex circuits need memory.

## [3. Processors](3.cpu.md)

mcpu16h is a very simple processor with only 4 instructions and is a good introduction
while drv32h is more practical, being compatible with the RISC-V standard.

## [4. FPGAs and Shin JAMMA](4.fpga.md)

With reconfigurable circuits (FPGAs - Field Programmable Gate Arrays) it is possible
to see the simulates circuits working in the real world. As there are many different
FPGA boards, the Shin JAMMA standard was created so a single project can work on
any of them

## [5. Video and Audio](5.av.md)

Though interesting games can be created to use the text terminal, color graphics output
and sound like those from the classic NES (Nintendo Entertainment System or Famicom)
allow games that are more fun

## [6. Pegasus 42](6.pegasus42.md)

With cache memory and high resolution graphics it becomes possible to run the Squeak Smalltalk programming language

## [A. History](A.hist.md)

In addition to the material presented in the workshop,
a history of the Pegasus project is also included as an
appendix.
