# A. History

From 1977 to 1991 Brasil had a "reserved market policy" for small scale computers. At the time nearly
all imports were forbidden, from automobiles to chocolate including computers. But for other products
a foreign company like Volkswagen or Nestlé could open factories in the country and sell locally.
The reserved market didn't allow this for the case of mini and microcomputers.

In times of high inflation and no economic growth, the computer sector was one of the few that was
greatly expanding. This attracted investment from non related areas, specially due to the opportunity
of copying foreign products without having to deal with competing with the originals. It was in this
context that a group from the financial sector contacted the lawyer Amaro Moraes e Silva Neto for
ideas, and Amaro told them that one thing nobody was making was a children's computer. He said he
knew a computer genius who could develop such a product.

He was thinking of Fábio Cavalcante da Cunha, who was officially an electronic engineering student
at the Polytechnical School of the University of Sâo Paulo (Poli-USP) but was then more focused on
his job at a computer store.
